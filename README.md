# Glossy
Solidity contract for creating and selling ERC721 tokens on Ethereum.

Glossy (glossy.cards) was the first system to generate ERC721 collectibles for sale for free in April 2018. This contract together with a Go backend and web interface made up the dapp. The Go backend consisted of a main API that interacted with the contract and a helper app that monitored the blockchain via Infura for events.
